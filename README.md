# Kaptar - a robot project

## Version 1.0
A simple balancing bipedal model was designed and trained. The PPO2 policy of [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/) was used to train the model. Quaternion of the body together with feet-touch-to-ground information were used for input layer of fully connected ANN with single hidden layer consisted of 90 neurons.
